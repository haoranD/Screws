Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer choices:
(A) In April, Natalia sold 48 clips. In May, Natalia sold 24 clips. So, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May. The answer is 72. So in May she sold 48 clips. Total clips sold in April and May = 72 + 48 = <<72+48=120>>120. The answer is 120
(B) Natalia sold 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 clips in May. The answer is 24. Natalia sold 48+24=<<48+24=72>> clips altogether. The answer is 72
